                    Dallas (of which it is the County Seat), Collin, Denton, Kaufman, and Rockwall. Dallas and the cities of the surrounding

                <p>Dallas has also proudly hosted the State Fair of Texas almost every year since 1886, interrupted only 
                    by World Wars I and II and by the COVID-19 pandemic. Held at the Cotton Bowl inside of Fair Park since 1929,
                    the "Red River Rivalry" football game between the University of Texas Longhorns and the Oklahoma Sooners is one
                    of the most famous events of the annual fair. The fair is also known for its auto show, its wide array of deep-fried foods, 
                    and, of course, Big Tex.
