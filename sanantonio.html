                <p>San Antonio's most famous landmark, <a href="https://www.thealamo.org/" target="_blank">the Alamo</a>, has a rich history. It was built over three-hundred years ago 
                    as a Spanish mission, originally named Mission San Antonio de Valero. In 1836, the Alamo was the site of a pivotal battle
                    in the Texas Revolution. 
                </p>
                <p>The city is also home to the <a href="https://www.thesanantonioriverwalk.com/" target="_blank">San Antonio Riverwalk</a> , 
                    an approximately 2.5-mile stretch of the San Antonio river that runs through the downtown area of the city.
                    The Riverwalk is lined with hotels, shops, and museums.
